## ðŸ›  Local Setup

To set up a local development environment, we'll only need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and use the `docker-compose.yml` file. Here are some useful commands:

```sh
# Build services.
docker-compose build

# Create and start containers.
docker-compose up

# Stop and remove started containers, remove unused volumes and start new containers.
docker-compose down && docker volume prune -f && docker-compose up --build

# Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced) and volumes.
docker system prune --all --volumes
```

### Prettier and ESLint

We are using `Prettier` for code formatting and `ESLint` as our code linter with the Airbnb's rules for TypeScript. Configure your editor so it formats your code automatically or use the following commands:

```sh
# Format the project code.
yarn format

#Run the linter.
yarn lint

# Fix linter errors automatically.
yarn lint:fix
```

### Run checks before a commit

Remember to always execute the following command before any commit to make sure that the format of your files are correct and the linter rules are applied correctly:

```sh
yarn run-checks
```

## ðŸ©º Health Check

The health endpoint `GET /health` should be maintained for monitoring and alerting purposes. This endpoint returns an OK response if the API is running correctly and lists the status of dependencies. For instance, the health endpoint may need to check that:

- database connection is established
- indispensable microservices are reachable
- external APIs are responding

## ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

Our environment variables are set in the `.env` file, which is present in the `.gitignore` file so it is never pushed to the repositories, you'll need to ask for the credentials to other team members.

There are two rules to consider when working with environment variables:

- They should not be used in the code directly. don't use the `process.env.ENV_VARIABLE` hack. Instead, use the configuration file: `src/config.ts`.
- Remember to update the `.env.example` file whenever you add or remove any environment variables so other developers can keep track of the required variables.

## ðŸ“Š Database

We are using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as our main database and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) as our ORM.

### Migrations

Configuration file `database/ormconfig.ts` is configured to use TypeORM's migrations.

To generate a migration based on the entities modifications:

```sh
yarn migration:generate
```

To run the migrations:

```sh
yarn migration:run
```

To revert the last migration:

```sh
yarn migration:revert
```

## ðŸ“œ Swagger

NestJS includes a Swagger module to programatically generate the API Swagger documentation following the [OpenApi Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). For detailed usage instructions check the [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/swagger). We are using the plugin provided by NestJS to generate the documentation automatically with `nest-cli.json`.

There is a document builder and a `SwaggerModule` in file `main.ts`. The `SwaggerModule.setup()` method sets the documentation to endpoint `/docs`.

- To visit the live Swagger doc: [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs).

- To download the Swagger documentation as a JSON file: [http://localhost:8080/docs-json](http://localhost:8080/docs-json)

## ðŸ“˜ Documentation

The `docs` folder contains the project's documentation. Please remember to keep it updated and add new files to the README.md index.
